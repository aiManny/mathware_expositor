  Solve the following high school mathematics problem:
  {problem_text}
  Provide your solution in the following format:
  1. The final numerical answer to the problem
  2. A detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem
  3. Python code that implements the solution and returns the answer
  Ensure that your Python code is executable and follows these guidelines:
  - Use only Python's built-in functions and the math module
  - Include comments explaining each step
  - Handle potential edge cases or invalid inputs
  - Return the final answer as the last line of the function
  Remember, this is a high school level problem, so advanced mathematical concepts or libraries should not be necessary.
